MoodleTest
==========

Moodle Test to create a Custom Block Plugin that show Moodle version, PHP version, User logged info and profile image. Also add a link, in Settings Block, under Advance Features link. That link open a custom page on Moodle environment to show the same info of the custom block. I add settings for the custom block, configurations fields and a link, triggered from the profile image in custom block, to the edit profile page.
